# VoShooter üî´

A very original top-down arena shooter

Taking inspiration from games like Quake, Counter-Strike and others we bring you a new, never before seen, totally original arena shooter. Fight in an arena against all of your closest friends or enemies, collect items and blow up others in this fast paced shooter. Or if you prefer fighting against a machine, go up against some of the most intelligent bots the world has ever seen.
